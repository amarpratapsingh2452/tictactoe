# tictactoc
This is where it all begins! A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — my first step into web development. More than just a game, it’s the project that helped me understand how real interaction works on the web.  I’m just getting started, and this is only the beginning of what I plan to build.
